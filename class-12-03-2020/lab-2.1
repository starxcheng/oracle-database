Lab question:
You are required to produce a report of customers who purchased products with list prices of more than $1000. The report must contain customer first and last names and the product names and their list prices. Customer information is stored in the CUSTOMERS table, which has the CUSTOMER_ID column as its primary key. The product name and list price details are stored in the PRODUCT_INFORMATION table with the PRODUCT_ID column as its primary key. Two other related tables may assist in generating the required report: the ORDERS table, which stores the CUSTOMER_ID and ORDER_ID information, and the ORDER_ITEMS table, which stores the PRODUCT_ID values associated with each ORDER_ID. There are several approaches to solving this question. Your approach may differ from the solution listed

3.
select c.cust_first_name, c.cust_last_name, p.product_name, p.list_price
from customers c
join orders o on (c.customer_id=o.customer_id)
join order_items oi on (o.order_id=oi.order_id)
join product_information p on (oi.product_id=p.product_id)

4.
 select cust_first_name, cust_last_name, product_name, list_price
